# GRATIS: Deep Learning Graph Representation with Task-specific Topology and Multi-dimensional Edge Features

This is the official code for the paper: GRATIS: Deep Learning Graph Representation with Task-specific Topology and Multi-dimensional Edge Features

## Updating [2022 Nov 28]

Note the current code is implemented by different co-authors. In the following weeks, it will be changed accordingly to form a more consistent project.

In the manuscirpt, we tried and reported the proposed GRATIS on three different tasks with five different face image datasets. Specifically, for i) Graph Classificaiton, the FER 2013 and RAF-DB facial expression recognition (FER) datasets are employed, where we produce a graph for each face image, and predict image-level facial expressions (i.e., seven class classification problem) based on the produced graph; for ii) Node Classification, the BP4D and DISFA Facial Action Units (AUs) Recognition datasets are employed, where the task is to jointly predict multiple AUsâ€™ activation from each face image; for iii) Link Prediction, the BP4D and DISFA datasets are again employed, where we aim to recognize the co-occurrence pattern between a pair of AUs (vertices), i.e., the edge pattern of the corresponding AUs.

## Graph Data

Six graph datasets are employed (two for each task): (i) Graph classification: the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets are employed; (ii) Vertex (node) classification: the PATTERN and CLUSTER datasets are employed; and (iii) Edge link prediction: the TSP and COLLAB datasets are employed.
