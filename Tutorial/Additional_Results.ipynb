    "Figure 3 provides the confusion matrices for the facial expression recognition task achieved on both FER 2013 and RAF-DB datasets (i.e., non-graph data-based graph classification task). Meanwhile, Figure 4 and Figure 5 provide the confusion matrices for AU co-occurrence pattern recognition  (i.e., non-graph data-based link/edge prediction task). Particularly, we report the confusion matrices for the best folds of each of our best approaches for each dataset, namely for the best ResNet-GAT system, the best ResNet-GatedGCN system, the best Swin-GAT system and the best Swin-GatedGCN system on both BP4D and DISFA. As per the classes, _both_ implies both AUs in the pair are active and _neither_ implies neither of the AUs in the pair are active. Furthermore, a pair is only considered once and was coupled in the order of ascending indices for each activation unit. To examplify, the AU pair consisting of AU1 (inner brow raiser) and AU24 (lip pressor) is considered once and as AU1\\&AU24. Therefore, the class _first_ in the confusion matrix implies that only the first element of the pair is active, in this example AU1 (inner brow raiser), whereas the class _second_ in the confusion matrix implies that only the second element of the pair is active, in this case AU24 (lip pressor). Finally, the confusion matrices were normalized in a row-wise manner for a better visualization of the percentage of correct and mistaken predictions for each class. Each row was normalized through L1 normalization.\n",
