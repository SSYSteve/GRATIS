    "A graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ is made up of a set of vertices $\\mathcal{V} \\subseteq \\{\\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times K} \\}$, and edges $\\mathcal{E} \\subseteq \\{ \\mathbf{e}_{i,j} = \\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j) \\mid \\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j \\in \\mathcal{V},  i \\neq j \\}$, where $\\mathbf{v}_i$ represents $K$ attributes of the $i_{th}$ object in the graph and $\\mathbf{e}_{i,j}$ represents the edge feature that defines the relationship between vertices $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$. Each pair of vertices can only be connected by at most one undirected edge or two directed edges. A standard way to describe such edges is through the adjacency matrix $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}| \\times |\\mathcal{V}|}$, where all vertices in a graph are ordered so that each vertex indexes a specific row and column. As a result, the presence of each edge $\\mathbf{e}_{i,j}$ can be described by a binary value $\\mathcal{A}_{i,j} = 1$ if $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$ are connected or $\\mathcal{A}_{i,j} = 0$ otherwise. Specifically, the adjacent matrix is always symmetric if all edges are undirected, but can be non-symmetric if one or more directed edges exist.\n",

    "##  2 Methods <a name=\"Methods\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Motivation\n",
    "A typical graph consists of a set of vertices and edges, where each vertex usually represents the mathematical abstraction of an object, and each edge describes the relationship between a pair of vertices. To encode a raw data sample as a graph, the majority of existing approaches manually define the vertices, the topology of the graph (i.e., edges' presence) as well as each edge's features based on pre-defined rules. Such hand-crafted strategies frequently assign the same topology for graph representations of all samples in the dataset. Subsequently, task-related connections may be ignored in the manually-defined graphs, and thus the performance of the graph analysis would be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge features are also essential components of graphs, the majority of existing graphs only employ a single value as each edge's feature to describe their relationships, which usually ignore crucial relationship cues. To comprehensively utilize rich relationship cues between vertices for graph analysis tasks, several studies developed novel edge message passing methods that allow GNNs to process multi-dimensional edge feature-based graphs. However, these methods only focus on efficiently processing multi-dimensional edge features that are already contained in the input graph. Although some studies manually design multi-dimensional edge features to describe some specific relationship between vertices, these hand-crafted edge features still fail to learn task-specific relationship cues between vertices. In summary, there is lack of a generic graph representation learning framework that can automatically generate a graph representation that has a task-specific topology and multi-dimensional edge features, for any arbitrary input data (i.e., pre-defined graph or non-graph data such as image, video, audio, and text).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: manually defined task-agnostic graph topology.**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a manually defined graph topology (represented as an adjacency matrix) $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}| \\times |\\mathcal{V}|}$, a pair of vertices $\\mathbf{v}^{l}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}^{l}_j$ are connected when their relationship meets the pre-defined criteria $\\mathcal{R}$, while no edge presented between a pair of vertices whose relationships are not considered by $\\mathcal{R}$. Assuming $\\mathcal{A}_{i,j} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ describes the presence of the edge $\\mathbf{e}_{i,j}$ between vertices $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$ in $\\mathcal{G}$, then it is represented as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{A}_{i,j} = \n",
    "    \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1 & \\{\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j \\} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\\\\n",
    "    0 &  \\text{Otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:edge}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "As aformentioned, the message passing of vertex features in the graph $\\mathcal{G}$ depends on its adjacency matrix $\\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, a manually defined adjacency matrix may not provide the task-specific message passing mechanism for the graph. In other words, properly exploring a task-specific adjacency matrix $\\mathcal{\\hat{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}| \\times |\\mathcal{V}|}$ for $\\mathcal{G}$ would allow vertex messages to be passed via task-specific paths, and result in better graph analysis performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: message passing via single-value edges.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While edges are essential components for a graph and decide its message passing process, many existing approaches only use a single value as each edge's representation (denoted as $\\mathbf{e}_{i,j} = [e_{i,j}(1)]$) to define either the edge's presence or the strength of association between a pair of vertices (i.e., $e_{i,j}(1) = \\mathcal{A}_{i,j}$). Let's define each vertex in a single-value edge feature-based graph $\\mathcal{G}$ as $\\mathbf{v}_j = [v_j(1), v_j(2), \\cdots, v_j(K)]$ ($j = 1, 2, \\cdots, N$). Then, the function $f$ in Eqa. \\ref{eq:message-passing} can be re-written as: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{v}_j,\\mathbf{e}_{i,j}) = f([v_j(1),\n",
    "\\cdots, v_j(K)], [e_{i,j}(1)])\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:single_edge}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the impact of the vertex $\\mathbf{v}_j$ on its adjacent vertex $\\mathbf{v}_i$ is only controlled by a single value $e_{i,j}(1)$, which may fail to include all crucial relationship cues between vertices $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$. Consequently, the messages passed via such single-value edges may not be optimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Gratis\n",
    "\n",
    "On contrary, our Gratis can **generate a task-specific graph representation with a task-specific topology and multi-dimensional edge features from an arbitrary graph or non-graph data**. The pipeline for graph and non-graph input is systematically consistent and is given in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipeline](pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gratis takes an arbitrary input $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{in}}$, and produces a task-specific graph representation $\\mathcal{\\hat{G}}(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{\\hat{E}})$ (or $\\mathcal{\\hat{G}}(\\mathcal{\\hat{V}}, \\mathcal{\\hat{E}})$ for non-graph data) which consists of $N$ vertices $\\mathcal{V} \\subseteq \\{\\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times K} \\}$ ($i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N$), and a set of **directed** edges whose presences are defined by a binary adjacency matrix $\\mathcal{\\hat{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$, where each of these presented **directed** edges is described by a task-specific multi-dimensional edge feature. These edges can be denoted as $\\mathcal{\\hat{E}} \\subseteq \\{ \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{i,j} = \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j) \\mid \\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j \\in \\mathcal{V} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{\\hat{A}}_{i,j} = 1 \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed framework consists of three modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the **Graph Definition (GD)** produces a basic graph representation $\\mathcal{G}^{\\text{B}}(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ from the input data $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{in}}$. The $\\mathcal{G}^{\\text{B}}(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ is defined by a set of vertex features $\\mathcal{V}$, a basic topology (adjacency matrix) $\\mathcal{A}$, and a set of basic edge features $\\mathcal{E} \\subseteq \\{ \\mathbf{e}_{i,j} = \\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j) \\mid \\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j \\in \\mathcal{V} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{A}_{i,j} = 1 \\}$;\n",
    "2. the **Task-specific Topology Prediction (TTP)** module produces a task-specific graph topology, i.e., replacing the basic graph topology defined by $\\mathcal{A}$ with a task-specific adjacency matrix $\\mathcal{\\hat{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$;\n",
    "3. the **Multi-dimensional Edge Feature Generation (MEFG)**  specifically assigns a task-specific multi-dimensional edge feature $\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{i,j}$ to each presented edge ($\\mathcal{\\hat{A}}_{i,j} = 1$), describing multiple task-specific relationship cues between vertices $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$ (i.e., replacing basic edge features $\\mathcal{E}$ with task-specific multi-dimensional edge features $\\mathcal{\\hat{E}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we train the GD, TTP, and MEFG with the backbone and GNN predictor in an end-to-end manner, both TTP and MEFG are learned to assign task-specific topology and edge features for the final produced graph representation. Moreover, the TTP and MEFG considers not only the relationship between corresponding vertex features but also the global contextual information of both vertices, to decide each edge's presence and feature. As a result, a task-specific graph representation $\\mathcal{\\hat{G}}(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{\\hat{E}})$ (or $\\mathcal{\\hat{G}}(\\hat{\\mathcal{V}}, \\mathcal{\\hat{E}})$ for non-graph data) whose topology is defined by $\\mathcal{\\hat{A}}$ can be obtained from any arbitrary input $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{in}}$ (i.e., if the input non-graph data is represented by a set of vectors, we concatenate them as a single matrix $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{in}}$)."

    "The VCR block takes vertex features  $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j$ and the global contextual representation $X$ as input. It first conducts cross attention between $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i$ and $X$ as well as $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j$ and $X$. Here, the vertex features $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j$ are independently used as queries to locate vertex-context relationship features $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$ in $X$ (i.e., $X$ is treated as the key and value for attention operations). Mathematically speaking, this process can be represented as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{F}_{i,x} = \\text{VCR}(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i, X) \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathcal{F}_{j,x} = \\text{VCR}(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j, X)    \n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "with the cross attention operation in VCR defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "     \\text{VCR}(A, B) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{A W_q (B W_k)^T}{\\sqrt{d_k} }) B W_v\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $W_q$, $W_k$ and $W_v$ are learnable weight vectors or matrices (depending on the shape of the input data) for the query, key and value encoding, respectively, and $d_k$ is a scaling factor set to the same as the number of the $B$'s channels. Subsequently, the produced $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$ contain the vertex $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i$-related and vertex $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j$-related task-specific cues extracted from the global contextual representation $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$, the VVR block further extracts task-specific context cues that relate to both vertices. VVR is also a cross-attention block that has the same form as VCR. In particular, it individually takes $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$ as the query and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$ as the key and value, as well as $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$ as the query and $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$ as the key and value, producing two context-aware vertex-vertex relationship features $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i}$, respectively. Here, the $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j}$ encodes $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$-related cues in the $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$, while the $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i}$ encoding $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}$-related cues in the $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}$. In other words, the context-aware vertex-vertex relationship features $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i}$ contain cues that not only come from the whole context, but also relate to both vertex $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_i$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_j$. We formulated this process as:\n",

    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j} = \\text{VVR}(\\mathcal{F}_{i,x}, \\mathcal{F}_{j,x}) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i} = \\text{VVR}(\\mathcal{F}_{j,x}, \\mathcal{F}_{i,x})    \n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Depending on the data shape, we finally employ either a pooling layer or a fully-connected layer, to flatten $\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i}$ to a pair of multi-dimensional edge feature vectors $\\mathbf{\\bar{e}}_{i,j}$ and $\\mathbf{\\bar{e}}_{j,i}$ (we denote this operation as $L$):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\bar{e}}_{i,j} = L(\\mathcal{F}_{i,x,j}) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\bar{e}}_{j,i} = L(\\mathcal{F}_{j,x,i})\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "As a result, each of the produced multi-dimensional edge feature encodes task-specific cues from the whole contextual cues of the input data $\\mathcal{D}^{\\text{in}}$, which relate to both $\\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\\mathbf{v}_j$.\n",
